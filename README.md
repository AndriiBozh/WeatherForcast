I made this project to practice 'streamlit' framework, 'requests' module, and how to process data received from a website.  
Requests are sent to openweathermap api.  
This project is a single-page website, built using 'streamlit'.  
User types a city/town into input field and then sees a weather forcast.  
They can select a number of days for 1-5 days weather forcast.  
They can select what data to see: temperature graph or icons with sky condition.
